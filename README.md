# Get on Your Bike and Ride

# Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the data of a bike-rental service, and determine the feasibility
of moving operations to a new city, as well as identifying a target audience

## Results

A series of visualizations were created for analysis: they follow

#1
![Bike Utilization](https://github.com/Jelsik/BikeSharing/blob/main/Graphs%20for%20Analysis/graph1.PNG)

As shown, the utilization of the bikes seem to be pretty uniform, however, some bikes seem to stand out.
They could be targeted for maintenence, or perhaps their stations need more bikes.

#2
![Trip Length By Age](https://github.com/Jelsik/BikeSharing/blob/main/Graphs%20for%20Analysis/graph2.PNG)

The duration of trips increases steadily as the customer becomes younger. Old birthdates should be considered outliers
or perhaps faked information. The likelyhood of a subscriber being nearly 150 years old is impossible.

#3
![Trip Length](https://github.com/Jelsik/BikeSharing/blob/main/Graphs%20for%20Analysis/graph3.PNG)

Most trips last less than an hour, and then crash hard as time increases.

#4
![Trip By Gender](https://github.com/Jelsik/BikeSharing/blob/main/Graphs%20for%20Analysis/graph4.PNG)

The trend is recognizable when split by gender, however, the majority of trips are made by males.

#5
![Ride Concentration](https://github.com/Jelsik/BikeSharing/blob/main/Graphs%20for%20Analysis/graph5.PNG)

Most rides are made during the rushhour times on weekdays, and weekend rides tend to max out during the daylight hours
somewhat evenly.

#6
![Ride Concentration Gender](https://github.com/Jelsik/BikeSharing/blob/main/Graphs%20for%20Analysis/graph6.PNG)

The pattern remains the same when broken down by gender, and again, males make up the majority.

#7
![Rides by Gender and Customer](https://github.com/Jelsik/BikeSharing/blob/main/Graphs%20for%20Analysis/graph7.PNG)

As shown in this graph, the majority of the riders across the board are subcribers.

## Summary

All things considered, our customerbase would appear to consist mainly of male subscribers who use our service 
to commute. They take their rides during major traffic hours, renting each bike usually for less than an hour.
These lengths are acceptable if the trips are concentrated in urban areas. If the city planned for expansion
has a living downtown, with businesses and walkable streets people would consider biking instead of driving,
then this plan may be viable.

Additional visualizations required would be one showing tripcount by station number, so station location
hotspots could be established. An additional graph showing utilization of these stations by day of the week
would be useful to try and establish popular time areas, for commute, or for leisure on the weekends, which may aid
in bike distribution or maitenence priority.
